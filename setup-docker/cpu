What about Configuring Memory, CPU and GPU?

You can configure docker run to accept flags for setting Memory, CPU and GPU. You can read more about it here in the official documentation. Here is a brief example of setting the CPU.

```sh
docker run -it --cpus=".25" ubuntu /bin/bash
```

This tells this container to use at max only 25% of the CPU every second.
